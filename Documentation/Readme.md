Documentation
=============
This directory is for the creation of documentation for developers. Natural GM
uses Doxygen to generate documentation files. To generate documents, use the
following command:

    doxygen Doxyfile

After building, open Index.html in a web browser, and you should be redirected
to the generated HTML documentation.
